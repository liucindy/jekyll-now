title: (day1) on why I want to write
---

I've never considered myself to be a particularly literary person -- I tell myself that I don't read enough books and that I don't have a particular knack for words. But I think literary or not, everyone has the desire and need to write. I always end up turning to writing when there's pain and sadness, but also joy, in my life. It gives me mental clarity, helps me process my experiences, and gives me confidence that I have something valuable to contribute when I share my writing with others. At points when I've felt lost and had no clarity in my life, I had also stopped writing. I've decided that I don't need to be a good writer to write. This practice of writing 750 words a day, apart from being a test of perseverance and commitment, will be a lesson on perfectionism. These writings will rarely -- if ever -- be perfect. There will simply not be enough time and energy for that.
