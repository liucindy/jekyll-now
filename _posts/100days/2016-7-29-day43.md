In *Quiet*, Susan Cain talks about how Eastern and Western cultures value introversion and extroversion differently. It's interesting to think that I'm caught in this in-between place -- I received the more Western training of an extrovert through school presentations and public speaking, but in my interactions with others and my sensitivity towards their feelings, I feel much closer to my Chinese upbringing. The important thing is to not let my reticence make me feel inadequate. I need to learn to trust my own substance and depth.
