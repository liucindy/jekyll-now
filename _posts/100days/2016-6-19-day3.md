Perhaps that's what adulthood is about -- the calmness and the knowledge that no matter what happens, this is just life and there is nothing to panic about. Perhaps adulthood is learning to accept the pain and the tears, and still having the strength to get up in the morning and the courage to allow someone else to hold your hand. Perhaps it's choosing to forgive others, rather than misery for yourself.

In some regards, I already feel like an adult. In others, I feel like my visions for the life I want are too lofty, too idealistic, too childlike. I want to love all the people I want to love and go to all the places I want to go with the eyes and heart of a child, because going as an adult seems too practical, too fearful, too cautious.
