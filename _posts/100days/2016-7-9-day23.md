title: day 23 - on being in control

One thought that's been nagging me is whether or not all my resolutions and daily goals will eventually tire me out. Having to write every day and exercising a certain number of times every week. Having a strict schedule for when to go to sleep and wake up, regulations on what I can and cannot eat when I'm hungry. Will I become high-strung, tense, and unable to let life happen as it is? But I think there's a difference between trying to control what happens *around* me and controlling myself. Attempting to control what's around me and then inevitably losing that control will cause me a lot of stress, but I'm after the kind of self-control and mindfulness that'll train me to be at ease even when things don't go my way. In fact, I realized on the bus this morning that this kind of discipline and routine is exactly what I need *in order to* be less tired and stressed. I pack my bag the night before so I don't have to worry in the morning. I remind myself to not dwell on certain thoughts so I can enjoy the present. It's surprising how these little things can add up and affect my mood. It seems counter-intuitive that routine and discipline could actually make us happier and more productive. Perhaps it's just a difficult task, so we think it will be tiring, even though when it becomes a habit, it will make us infinitely happier.
