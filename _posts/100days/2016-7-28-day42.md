I got a piece of advice from a (near) stranger today. I asked him how he continues to learn on his job, even though his profession largely involves coaching other people. "Whenever I meet a client or participate in a meeting I've been to hundreds of times already, I decide I will learn at least one new thing from this person or this event." He called this "setting a filter." We have to be especially mindful when it comes to things that are familiar to us.
