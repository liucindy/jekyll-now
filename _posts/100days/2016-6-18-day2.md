title: day 2 - on my biggest fear
permalink: /100days/day2

It makes me go into what I now realize could be considered a panic attack -- my brain feels like it's swelling, I start to get tunnel vision, and my only thought is to run away as quickly as possible. It's something I feel I can't tell other people about, because it seems like such an irrational fear that I should be able to get over. I've thought about going to therapy for it. I've only ever mentioned it to two people, and both times, it had subconsciously been a way to test how much I could trust them. Not even my parents know. Sometimes I have nightmares about it and I wake up almost relieved, because I know the universe cannot be so cruel as to make me experience my biggest fear in both my dreams and in reality. I hate myself for not being able to overcome it. I hate that it's such an integral part of society, which means I can't go on fearing it forever, or at least avoiding it forever. Sometimes I wish I could be reborn, with nothing different except for this fault.
