title: day 2 - on my biggest fear
permalink: /100days/day2

It makes me go into what I now realize could be considered a panic attack -- my brain feels like it's swelling, I start to get tunnel vision, and my only thought is to run away as quickly as possible. I've thought about going to therapy for it. I've only ever mentioned it to two people, and both times, it had been a way to test how much I could trust them. Sometimes I have nightmares about it and I wake up almost relieved, because I know the universe cannot be so cruel as to make me experience my biggest fear in both my dreams and in reality. I feel silly for not being able to overcome it. I hate that it's such an integral part of society, which means I can't go on fearing it, or at least avoiding it, forever. Sometimes I wish I could be reborn, with nothing different except for this fault.
