title: day 35 - on differences in work culture

A question I get asked very often is whether I'd like to come back to work in China in the future. When I was younger and still knew nothing about the professional world, my claim was that I wouldn't, because the working culture would be very different from what I'm used to from growing up in a Western education system. Now that I've had some real experience working in Asia, I have more thoughts on this topic. A most recent example of differences is when my supervisor completely redid a presentation some fellow interns and I had prepared to give at the end of our internship. He not only sketched out pretty much exactly what he wanted on each slide, but also tried to have a hand in summarizing what *we* had learned from our experience at the company. I was taken aback, to say the least, and verged on being offended. In the end I went along with it, partly because he did make some valid points, but mostly because I wanted to avoid conflict.

It's not to say that these differences are necessarily going to deter me from working in Asia in the future, but it'll just be something to think about when weighing my options. Plus, there's no guarantee that I won't experience "culture shock" working for a company elsewhere.
