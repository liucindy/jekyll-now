title: day 29 - on friendship

I think about all the people that once came into my life and had some sort of impact, and I know that I should miss them for who they were to me. But for some reason, I seem to always fail at conjuring up any strong emotions, and in the end it feels like more of a rational decision to miss them. What is friendship to me? Is it the people who are physically closest to me in the moment, or people that I now only keep in contact with through technology?
