I've only just begun to realize why we say that art is a form of self-expression. Through photography, I feel like I get to express how I see the world -- the details I notice, the people that catch my attention, and the things that are important to me. I think part of the magic and power of photography is its ability to capture and convey such rich, powerful and complex human experiences or emotions with nothing more than a still image.
