I'm always pleasantly surprised by how one place can remind me so much of another place that is far away and seemingly very different. Standing at the top of Kowloon Peak, I saw myself back in Nacíon Q'eros in Peru, and our hikes over and around the mountains. Or how seeing the city of Hong Kong and the harbor from above suddenly brought me back to the view from Baolong Temple of Jishou and its winding river.
