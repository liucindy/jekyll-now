I'm always pleasantly surprised by how one place can remind me so much of another place that is far away and seemingly very different. As I stood at the top of Kowloon Peak, I suddenly saw myself back in Nac√≠on Q'eros in Peru, and our hikes over and around the mountains. Or how seeing Hong Kong and the harbor from above suddenly brought me back to the view from Baolong Temple of Jishou and its winding river.
