It's been a year, to the day, since we boarded a train from Shanghai to Jishou. Sometimes I wonder if I think about it too much and have become too attached -- as if I can't move on. But often you can't pinpoint the reasons why a certain thing, place or person makes you feel a certain way. It's too many small things put together, although there are always more defining moments that you might use again and again to explain your feelings to other people, or to reason with yourself during the more difficult moments.
