The outdoors, for me, have always been a place of tremendous growth. It taught me how to be comfortable with the uncomfortable. It taught me to embrace my limits -- because everyone has weaknesses -- and to not let them define me. It taught me how to take care of other people and what it means to be a leader. It gave me confidence, and taught me to trust myself in the face of new challenges. Even so, every time I go on another OA trip, there is a moment when I question why I've put myself in this situation again -- no shower, no bathroom, and going to bed with a sore back. By now, though, I feel I almost have a psychotic need to push myself and make myself uncomfortable by going to the outdoors. It makes me realize that most discomforts in life are only temporary.

It's interesting to compare attitudes surrounding the outdoors across different cultures. I feel that in China, the outdoors is often associated with hard physical labor and a less desirable lifestyle. In the US, the outdoors is more of a leisure activity, and being able to access it suggests a certain degree of privilege. And then there are the people in places like Nac√≠on Q'eros, for whom the outdoors is not a choice but an extremely harsh reality. I never thought how being seen as "outdoor-sy" could be a sign of my privilege, but now I realize how mistaken I was.
