title: day 37 - on work-life balance

Looking back on the past two years, I realize I haven't been deliberate enough in creating a good work-life balance. Part of it is that I never really allow schoolwork to end -- when I'm done with a task I almost always immediately move onto the next to do, but there is never an end to all the work that can be done. The other part is that I'm not deliberate and resolute enough in deciding how I want to spend my free time when I have it. Because of this, I usually pick what's easy (like checking Facebook) or what's most convenient (like sitting at late meal and just chatting with whoever happens to be passing by). It's not that I shouldn't allow this free-form kind of work-life balance, but that I need to make more resolutions about how many times I exercise a week, when/what to read, and who I reach out to for meals or to hang out. I used to think a good work-life balance simply meant having time to do the things I enjoyed outside of school, but now I know I need to be more specific, and possibly even quantify those activities, to achieve the true balance I want and need.
