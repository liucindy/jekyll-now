When I was in Jishou last summer, I visited an orphanage once a week as part of leading "Service Club." There, I met a  girl called Yolanda, who is only physically disabled and super sweet. Out of the blue, I got an email from her yesterday. I was very shocked, as I'd largely forgotten about that part of my Jishou experience. Hearing from her and deciding whether I should visit when I go back to Jishou has made me think about why I do service. Even last summer, I debated whether or not to visit the orphanage in the first place, because I knew I would be unable to continue my visits or to see the kids again after I left. But it was a very eye-opening experience for me, and I hope we brought them genuine joy and laughter in the short time we were there. At school, I volunteer as an English teacher at El Centro, and I really enjoy learning from my students, even though the process exhausts me every time. From them, I learn resilience, perseverance and humor. They force me to learn about myself as well: my threshold of patience, my energy levels, the ways I express -- and don't express -- myself. To me, it's not just about leaving the Orange Bubble, but also a weekly reminder that this is the kind of work that makes me feel the most alive.
