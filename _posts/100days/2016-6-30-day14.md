One of the most important things travel has taught me is empathy, and the understanding that my opinions or lifestyle are not the only one. It reminds me that my problems are not the most important. It's taught me that the world is big but there are similarities to be found everywhere. It makes me wonder about all the people around me, each with their lives running parallel to mine, which I too often treat as the only one that exists. No matter where you are -- somewhere familiar or completely unfamiliar -- you can find yourself a different patch of sky and stand under it for a while. The hard part is knowing where to look, or knowing to keep your eyes peeled for it.
