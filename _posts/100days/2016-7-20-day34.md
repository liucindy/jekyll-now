Sometimes people will ask me (and I then I'll wonder myself) what motivates me to get up early in the morning even when I don't have class or when I actually need the sleep. I think part of the reason (which I'm ashamed to admit) is that I'm deeply competitive (yes, even in something as trivial as waking up other people). A more practical reason is that I'm a very light sleeper and I'd rather wake up earlier by myself than be woken up by noise from other people. A better reason is that I enjoy the moments of rare solitude in the morning when I can ride to work or get breakfast by myself, without having to think about socializing while still being in a state of half-sleep.
