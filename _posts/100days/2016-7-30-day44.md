My resolutions for next year: read, write, run, and eat vegetarian. Also, to really allow myself to pursue my interests and to accept myself for who I am. It's about time I started making choices that are true to myself. What do other people care anyways? In the end, it's my life to live. I think I worry too much about whether the career I want to pursue is "prestigious" or "respectable" enough, but have I thought about becoming the best at what I do? No matter what you do -- even if it's just making charcoal egg waffles -- if you can do it well, people will respect you for it.
