 I feel guilty that I don't speak out more about this issue, even though I know that silence is a kind of complicit endorsement. I know that as a minority myself, I should be more active in this struggle. But perhaps I haven't found my way of speaking out yet -- a way that is comfortable for me, but that also allows me to express what I believe is right. Then again, this issue is not about comfort. In fact, it's about the complete opposite of comfort.
