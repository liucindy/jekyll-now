It got to a point where I felt I would always be an outsider, because of my faith (or lack of it). I knew it was all in my head, but you can't help but validate those feelings because you can't pretend anymore. I don't want to be close-minded and unwilling to meet new people or discover new ideas, even though I know that's exactly what I'm doing right now.
