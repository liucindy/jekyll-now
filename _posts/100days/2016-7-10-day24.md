Recently reading: *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running* by Haruki Murakami

> Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

Surprisingly, I find myself having a lot in common with Murakami. I like what he says about running, and how it's one of the few things in most people's lives that is not done to out-perform others, but that's purely for ourselves.
