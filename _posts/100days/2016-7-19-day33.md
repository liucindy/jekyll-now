title: day 33 - on my favorite study spot at school

My favorite study spot at Princeton is definitely the Princeton Public Library. Going there always puts me at ease and allows me to focus better. I like how there's a lower chance I'll run into someone I know, so I won't be forced to socialize. I like seeing all sorts of people from all walks of life reading and doing different things, which reminds me that there's a world beyond schoolwork. I like its perfect balance of noise and silence. The chairs are comfortable, the light is just right, and the temperature is never too hot or too cold. I like walking back to campus around dinnertime, as the sun starts setting over Rocky and people are going to dinner on Nassau and down Witherspoon. Subconsciously, I think it's also my way of avoiding collaboration with other people, as I like working alone and going at my own pace, instead of worrying about how I'm doing in relation to other people.
