Recently reading: *Quiet* by Susan Cain

I wish I could be the kind of leader that organized group outings on the weekends or trips to the arcade after dinner. But the reality is I often don't have enough energy for that, especially after a day or meal of hard-core socializing. But I know I can be a leader in my own, quiet way, like facilitating group dynamics and relationships through deliberate activities. Just like high energy, I think reflexivity and thoughtfulness can rub off on other people.
