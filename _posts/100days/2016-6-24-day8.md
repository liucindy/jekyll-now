title: day 8 - on memories of high school
permalink: /100days/day8

It's interesting that I haven't really thought about high school recently. I seem to no longer be spontaneously reminded of things that happened in high school, and instead need visual or verbal cues to remind me that certain things happened or that certain people existed. Maybe I have too much distance from it now, and I can no longer relate to the emotions I felt then. I can't really remember what pained me or made me laugh. I've forgotten how to recreate those feelings, and the associated memories have fallen away as well. My most vivid and treasured memory from high school is of the softball team. It gave me so much happiness, fulfillment, and a sense of belonging. Sometimes, I still think or have dreams about being back with the team. The images are more blurry and the emotions less intense, but it continues to bring me a sense of calm and peace.
