Recently reading: *The Happiness Project* by Gretchen Rubin

I realize now that I need to be more deliberate about what thoughts I allow myself to think, and how I spend my time. Don't think that if someone else achieves something, they're taking something away from you. The world does not come in the way of a pie that only has a finite number of pieces.

I think too often, I've fought with my true, inner self and its interests and tendencies, in hopes that I could be a different, "better" person, someone who possessed all the positive qualities that I admired in other people. But the truth is that no matter how much I want to change, the fundamentals will not change. This is who I am, and the combination of my strengths and weaknesses, merits and flaws make me who I am. The key is understanding the difference between areas where I can improve, and things that I might not like about myself but aren't necessarily negative qualities.
