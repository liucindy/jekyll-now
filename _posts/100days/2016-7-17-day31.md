Recently reading: *Lean In* by Sheryl Sandberg

I still remember the first time I consciously felt I was being sidelined because of my gender. I've been luckier -- or perhaps just more oblivious -- than most: I didn't have this experience until my second year of college. I first noticed how I was constantly being cut off mid-sentence by this male peer while other male peers in my group were allowed to finish their thoughts. I then noticed how quickly my ideas were dismissed, or repeated almost word-for-word back at me a while later as I stared back, shocked at how he claimed the idea as his own. Initially, I thought it was because of my personality and lack of assertiveness, but soon, I realized that he simply had no interest in really listening to what I had to say. I also felt ashamed that it took experiencing it for myself to make me truly aware of gender issues.
