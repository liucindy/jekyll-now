The idea of a turning point implies that your life would now be very different if not for that incident, though of course, you can never really know how things would've turned out otherwise. I wonder if there are ever such definitive moments in our lives, or if realizations build up moment by moment. Or maybe we can only recognize turning points in retrospect, when we can see how all the dots have been connected.
