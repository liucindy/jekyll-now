You know you absolutely need to fall asleep because you have to wake up in less than six hours, but your mind just won't let you. It brings up memories from the past and makes up all sorts of variations. It gets you thinking about the future and imagines all the things you want to do, and you get so excited your heart starts racing. It's when you resign yourself to waking up exhausted in the morning that somehow your mind calms down and allows you to fall into the deep recess of sleep, so gently that when you wake, you can't remember what your last thought was, or why you were thinking it.
