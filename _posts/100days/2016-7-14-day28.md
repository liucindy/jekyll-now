Posting my photography on social media makes me wonder: what is the point of photography? It makes me realize that like running and writing, you can't do it for other people. You can't do it for the likes or the publicity, because there can never be an end to that. The point is to set standards for yourself, and to work hard to achieve those standards. There is no other way to improve, and no other way to enjoy the process. If you don't enjoy the process, then what's the point of doing it?
