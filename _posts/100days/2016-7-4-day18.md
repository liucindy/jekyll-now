title: day 18 - on my relationship with food
permalink: /100days/day18

When I'm at school, I feel that I almost have a toxic relationship with food. Sometimes, I'll eat three cookies in one sitting and hate myself afterwards. Or I'll continue to eat at meals even when I'm not hungry. I know that this lack of self control around food is a reflection of deeper emotional imbalance and stress. *Don't want to do work?* Stay here and have another cookie! *Craving sugar and junk food?* Here, have some junk food, and then wallow in self-hatred! It's as if I get some twisted high from "punishing" my body for its cravings by feeding it unhealthily, knowing full well how bad it will make me feel later. But now I realize that I don't have to fight a battle with my own body. It's not about getting back at or punishing it, but about learning to love and care for it. It's about taking time to understand the deeper roots of my emotional dissatisfaction. It's about finding and reminding myself of other ways to feel fulfilled -- ways that will make me feel good about myself rather than hate myself. After all, it's just food. Think about something else for a while and the craving will go away.
