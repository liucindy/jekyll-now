The rain here is unlike any I've even seen or experienced. Sometimes the rain starts as if the sky suddenly started to cry, like a toddler who suddenly starts throwing a tantrum. Then it lets up for a bit, like the toddler as he surveys his surroundings with wide eyes, checking to see if he's garnered any attention from the adults. When he's disappointed that they're still going about their tasks, he starts up again, except this time with more vigor. Like when dealing with a wailing toddler, the important thing is to not let the rain get to you.
