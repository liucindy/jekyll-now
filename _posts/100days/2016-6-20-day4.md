I've never been much of a social media person. No Twitter, no Instagram, not even Snapchat or Yik Yak. On one hand I know I'll end up wasting too much time. But on a deeper level, I think I hardly ever post anything because I'm too afraid of what people will think or say of me. Perhaps it's because I don't yet know what kind of "online personality" I want to be that I refuse to craft any at all. I lurk and observe, but when I do post something, I will also obsess and check back every 5 minutes within the first half hour to see who's liked my post.

My relationship with social media is a weird mix of motivations -- masked by indifference yet permeating with insecurity. Sometimes when I scroll through Facebook, I feel reminded of how little I've done and how unconvincing my opinions are. Yet I also instinctively go to it when I'm looking for an escape from work, as a means of procrastination.
