title: day 7 - on a book you re-read

The only book I have voluntarity re-read is *Pride and Prejudice* (I read it again last month). I love it because Jane Austen's writing is like a puzzle, and she keeps me on my (figurative) toes, because if I'm not, I know I'll start to miss out on the nuances or even the meanings of her sentences. She also has the ability to express complex human emotions so precisely, and in reading her writing, there is a satisfaction of someone finally expressing something you've felt for a long time but didn't know how to put into words. It's funny to think about this prompt after recently finishing Aziz Ansari's *Modern Romance*, which discusses love and relationships in such a different era and through such different mediums.
