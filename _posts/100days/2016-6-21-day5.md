title: day 5 - on my relationship with my (smart)phone
permalink: /100days/day5

I like to think that I have a pretty healthy relationship with my phone. I believe in living in the moment and not being attached to my phone 24/7. Having a smartphone has definitely decreased my attention span and productivity, though. One thing I've noticed is how quickly I now lose focus -- often, I'll take out my phone to check the weather, get distracted by my email, and 15 minutes later will put my phone away, only to realize I never did what I had taken my phone out for.

What do we gain from using our phones all the time? Convenience. Protection from feelings of insecurity when we don't want to or don't know how to interact with other people. It makes us look constantly busy, when sometimes we're just swiping between pages deciding on which app to check again. I also think of my phone as a storage device for memories of texts and photos with important people in my life, which is funny because who knows when I will drop my phone in the toilet and it could all be gone.

The other day at home I picked up the orange Nokia slide phone I won in a drawing context (haha) in 6th grade. I wonder what my relationship with my (not-so-smart) phone was back then. But maybe it's not so much about the phone, but the thing or the person we're trying to get at *through* our phone. Like recently, I've been less dependent on my phone, perhaps as a way to give myself some distance from certain relationships. I feel if I can treat my phone with indifference, I can prove to myself that life goes on without those people. It's funny that my phone is tied up in so much of my emotional turmoil. Maybe it has become an extension of me after all, and I just haven't -- or am not willing to -- admit it.
