Sometimes coding or debugging feels like you're wandering around in a maze. You walk for a long time with no idea where you're going, but for some reason or another, you get an idea to try something and things start to work. It's a bizarre process that seems to bank so much on that chance thought or observation. Or perhaps it's not really chance when you've spent a lot of time with the code already and have gained a lot of experience and expertise that way.
