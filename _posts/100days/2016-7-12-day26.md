> It's precisely my ability to detect some aspects of a scene that other people can't, to feel differently than others and choose words that differ from theirs, that's allowed me to write stories that are mine alone. (What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Haruki Murakami)

I think to be a good photographer or documentary filmmaker requires a kind of astuteness -- the ability to capture human emotions and human life at its most complex and fragile moments. It requires being able to catch the subtle changes in mood of an interviewee, and capitalizing on that in a productive way to create and elicit something powerful. It's not to brag to say that I think I notice some things that others don't, because I also don't notice things that others do. It's just strange that I would be into something like interviewing people, when I grew up telling myself how difficult it was for me to talk and relate to other people.
