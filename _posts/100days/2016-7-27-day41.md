It's funny how I've been reading *Quiet* by Susan Cain where she mentions a public-speaking organization called Toastmasters, and how there was an actual event held near my office today. I even ended up giving a two minute impromptu speech based on that day's theme of "fantasy," and I talked about my fantasy of being a documentary filmmaker and photographer. It felt good to finally articulate this idea out loud, albeit to a room full of people I didn't know. It was nerve-wrecking, but I think it afforded me the kind of personal growth and improvement that I've been after, but haven't gotten all summer.
