The summer of 16, I decided to pursue a personal project during which I wrote in my journal for 100 consecutive days.

The posts on this blog are excerpts from my daily writings, either taken word-for-word or slightly edited for content. None of them are intended to be deep or profound, but my hope is that even just one line might resonate some reader out there, sort of as a way to give back to all the writers that pulled me out of my darkest moments, or helped me begin to understand myself and my place in this world.

If you have any thoughts or feedback, please (please!) write to me. I would love to hear from you, whether or not we've ever met.
